#The O Language
The O Language is an esoteric programming language used for [code-golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com).

##Getting the O interpreter
You can go to [github.com/phase/o](https://github.com/phase/o) to get the latest intpreter. You have to build it yourself, but there will be a quicker way in the future.

##Have an issue?
If you found a bug, or want to learn how to do something, you can [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/phase/o/issues).

##How do I code in this mystical language?
If you want a taste of some O action, check out the [examples](http://o.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/) page. If you want to learn how to use this kick-butt language, there's a [tutorial](http://o.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/) just for that!
