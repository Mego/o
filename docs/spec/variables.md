#Variables
Variables hold one value that can be pushed to the stack. To make a variable, you use `:`. This will take the value on the top of the stack and set the variable's value to it.
```
4:C
```
C is now set to 4. This will override any numbers, so using C wonâ€™t push 12 anymore, it will push 4. You can use any Unicode characters, but they will add to you byte count.

To push the value of a variable, you just have to use it as an operator.
```
4:k;kk+
```
The stack now holds 8:

* 4 is pushed
* the value of k is set to 4
* 4 is popped off
* k is pushed twice, putting two 4s on the stack
* the two 4s are added together, leaving 8

To change the value of a variable, you just have to reassign it to the top of the stack using `:`.
```
4:l;5:l;ll*
```
The top of the stack is now `25`.

##Pre-defined Variables
`Q` gets input as a Number if the input is a Number, or String if it is a String. It will also set the variable `Q` to what you inputted, just like Pyth's `Q`.
```
QQ+
```
*Input: `5`, Output: `10`*

`z` gets input as a String. It will also set the variable `z` to what you inputted, just like Pyth's `z`.
```
zz+
```
*Input: `5`, Output: `55`*

`J` will define a new variable called `J` that has the value of the top of the stack, just like if you did `:J`. `K` will do the same.

`G` is `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`.
